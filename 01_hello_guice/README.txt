============================================
  Hello World Codelab - Hello Guice
============================================

Task for this step:

  Can you add a new Guice-configured object that
  is used by the Hello resource class?


For Example:

  - Add a (joda) DateTime to the message with a Guice-configured
    date format. 
  
  - Make HelloResource display a different message based on
    the current time of day : good morning, good afternoon, good evening ...

Extra Credit:

  - How would you update the tests so that all messages may be 
    easily tested? (Hint: need a way to pass in the 'current' time
    to use in the tests)
